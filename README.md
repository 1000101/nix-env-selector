# Nix Environment Selector (ðŸ§ª *Experimental Release*)

![badge](https://action-badges.now.sh/arrterian/nix-env-selector)

The extension allows you switch environment for Visual Studio Code and extensions based on `.nix` config files.

## Motivation

Nix package manager provides a convenient solution for creating isolated environments with a specific configuration of packages. This way is working as well from the command line, but not prepared for using with IDE. For example, if you have a language server extension that requires a compiler installed inside an isolated environment is no simple way to link 'em with each other. The solution allows you to manage the environment for projects based on Visual Studio Code workspace.

## Getting started

* First of all, you should install [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/).
* [Install the extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arrterian.nix-env-selector)
* Prepare your nix env config with extension `.nix` and place in your project workspace.

> You can set non-workspace located file but in this case, you should set full path into parameter `"nixEnvSelector.nixShellConfig"` in your config.

* Type `"Select environment"` in command pallet

## Haskell Project running example

We have the following config for our environment (`shell.nix`):

```nix
{ nixpkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
let
  inherit (nixpkgs) pkgs;
  inherit (pkgs) haskellPackages;

  haskellDeps = ps: with ps; [
    base
    lens
    mtl
    random
  ];

  ghc = pkgs.haskell.packages.ghc864.ghcWithPackages haskellDeps;

  nixPackages = [
    ghc
    pkgs.gdb
    haskellPackages.cabal-install
  ];
in
pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "snadbox-haskell-workspace";
  buildInputs = nixPackages;
}
```

Haskell IDE Engine installed in the user environment and require GHC compiler for work correctly. We want to avoid to install the compiler globally such as different project can require a different version of GHC. We will install the GHC compiler inside the NIX store (described in `shell.nix` above).

Now let's try to open our project in Visual Studio Code.

![Without Env Demo](resources/without-env-demo.gif)

You can see that IDE can't find a compiler. Let's enable the `shell.nix` env.

![With Env Demo](resources/with-env-demo.gif)

Bingo ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. Everything is fine now ðŸ˜ˆ

## Supported Platforms

The extension has been tested on macOS. The extension Should work on the Linux platform as well, but not tested yet. Feel free to create an issue if you found a problem.
